# Geodash-3D Level Editor

## About
This is a level editor for Geodash-3D, a 3D game inspired by the popular mobile game Geometry Dash that goes to the third dimension.

I created Geodash-3D to test my knowledge of OpenGL and this is a level editor I made so that making game levels was easier for me and anyone who wants to create their own custom levels.

## How to use the editor
TBA

## Compile the project
To compile the project just run the following commands:

```
cmake -S geodash3-editor -B geodash3-editor/build
cd geodash3-editor/build
make
```

After that, merely run the command `./gdash3-editor` to run the executable and use the editor.
